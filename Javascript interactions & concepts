Java Script Interactions Added:
1. I added a button that changes the font color from white to black on the web page.
2. I added a dynamic greeting card that displays a time-based greeting with the user's name on the web page

Jave Script Concepts used:
1. Event listener was used for the change font color button.
2. Variable declaration with "if", "else", and "else if" was used for the greeting card.
